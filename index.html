<p>Without telling my age, I'm nearing the end of my military career and ready for retirement after 20 years. Throughout my time in the military, I’ve had the opportunity to travel across the globe. I have been to countries such as France, England, and Scotland. I’ve also been able to live in places such as Spain and Japan. My experiences have helped me become more versatile and understand life in general.</p>
